## AUTHOR: RAQIB AQEEL
# INTRODUCTION: 
Welcome to my capstone project on SPAIN CASE STUDY BETWEEN 2009 TO 2016, that is part of specialization on Globalization, Economic Growth and Stability course-1 (one) Understanding Economic Policymaking on coursera platform.
## TASK:
In this Capstone Project I will have to analyse Spain for either the period of 2000-2008 or the period of 2009-2016. 
I will answer the following questions for the period, I have chosen 2009-2016 by simply studying the data, by graphing and observing it and later Analyzing it. 
+ 1. Was the country in an inflationary or a recessionary gap in this period? 
+ 2. Did unemployment and inflation rates behave as expected for the type of gap you have identified above?
+ 3.  Did the country´s authorities follow an appropriate fiscal policy in this period?
+ 4. Did the public debt in this period represent a risk?
+ 5. Did the country´s authorities follow an appropriate monetary policy in this period?
+ 6. If you were to advise a potential investor in Spain during the period you have chosen, what would you highlight as the key risks and opportunities?  

# DATA:

The data is available on OECD website ( www.oecd.org ) and search for the latest OECD Economic Outlook: Statistics and Projections. This data source includes some future data, based on the organization´s projections, and it is an outstanding compilation of all sorts of macroeconomic data of relevance to economists and policymakers.  
The appropriate link to access the data, the exact link is ( http://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=EO103_INTERNET&lang=en ). In the Customize tab at the far left, go to Selection and select Country: Spain and then at Time & Frequency, the time period I have chosen (2009-2016). For variables under that same tab, I will have to select all of the following:
 + 1. GDP Growth (Gross domestic product, volume growth).  
 + 2. Underlying or core inflation rate (Harmonized core inflation).
 + 3. Headline or CPI inflation rate (Harmonized headline inflation).
 + 4. Unemployment rate.
 + 5. Recessionary or inflationary gaps (Output gap as a percentage of potential GDP). 
 + 6. Fiscal deficit (General government net lending as a percentage of GDP).
 + 7. Fiscal debt (Gross public debt; Maastricht criterion as a percentage of GDP).
 + 8. Debt service (Net general government interest payments as a percentage of GDP).
 + 9. Short-term interest rate.

# ANALYZE STEP:
Let’s Analyse the Economic situation of Spain during the year between 2009- 29016 by giving answers above the following questions: 

## QUESTION: 1
### Was the country in an inflationary or a recessionary gap in this period? 

## Answer 1: 
For this question, I will use Output gap as a percentage of potential GDP data from OECD Data.  That is available in the given link ( https://stats.oecd.org/viewhtml.aspx?datasetcode=EO103_INTERNET&lang=en# )

### I will represent this data on graph to get clear view.

 According to OECD Data, which is output gap as a percentage of potential GDP that measure whether Spain is experiencing an inflationary gap or recessionary gap, in this period 2009-2016, the value of output gap was in negative throughout the period. Thus, the Spain was experiencing recessionary gap.

## QUESTION No. 2
### Did unemployment and inflation rates behave as expected for the type of gap you have identified above? 

## Answer 2: 

I will use these three data to answer the question, all the data are available in the OECD website  
 
+ 1.Underlying or core inflation rate (Harmonized core inflation). 
+ 2. Headline or CPI inflation rate (Harmonized headline inflation). 
+ 3. Unemployment rate.

### Let’s represent these Data on a single table so I can analyse and observe the data and make a graph to get clear view.

Let’s now create a line graph to get clear view on these data.

Yes, because as we know Spain was in recessionary gap. , we can expect the unemployment rates to go up and inflation rates to go down. According to the theory Phillips curve preciously talks about the relation.
  In the time of recessionary gap, the unemployment tends to be rising at the time and it even hit a record of 26.09% in the year 2012 and also in the preceding years unemployment remained high.
  Inflation rates were too as expected were going down to very low levels Core Inflation rate into negative numbers in the year 2014, whereas CPI inflation rate was in negative for 3 years from 2014 to 2016

## QUESTION No. 3
### Did the country´s authorities follow an appropriate fiscal policy in this period?

## ANSWER: 3

Let’s see fiscal deficit Data to know that fiscal policy was appropriate or not.

In the recessionary gap, countries are advice to follow expansive fiscal policies or needs fiscal deficit to improve their economy. Yes Spain’ authorities follow appropriate fiscal policy in the period 2009-2016. According to OECD Data, Spain’s fiscal deficit was between -10.95% and -4.51% as a percentage of GDP, so from the Data we know that the government is trying to expand the economy from recessionary gap to reach potential GDP.

## QUESTION No. 4
### Did the public debt in this period represent a risk?

## ANSWER:
Let’s see the Fiscal debt data from OECD Economic Outlook Spain 2009-2016.

 Now let’s put data on graph for clear view. 
 
 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90096554/143865654-a2103ad3-86b4-4ede-a280-c7d59c2a53c3.png)

Yes, Spain’s gross public debt in period 2009-2016 is very high, we can see trend in the graph upward sloping. According to OECD Data, its gross public debt was between 52.78% and 100.37% as percentage of GDP.  Moreover, its interest payment in 2009-2016 always increases as a percentage of GDP. This needs to be solved because it can cause higher debt and interest payments and the future generations will face this risk even worse.

## QUESTION: 5
### Did the country´s authorities follow an appropriate monetary policy in this period?

### ANSWER:
Let’s look at the short-term interest rate set by ECB.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90096554/143865798-ccf04462-4f7a-4f7e-84f1-4a6edf3c8b17.png)

Let’s make a line graph so we can see trends of interest rate and we will get clear view of the data.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90096554/143865871-fb216bc7-503e-450a-9683-0a74950e6bbe.png)

 
After reviewing the data and graph we can say that monetary policies set by ECB in the period of 2009-2016 was appropriate. This was because they keep the short-term interest rate very low (close to 0%) to increase liquidity in the economy, so that the economy could expand and out of from a recessionary gap and trends also showing downward sloping.

## QUESTION: 6
### If you were to advise a potential investor in Spain during the period you have chosen, what would you highlight as the key risks and opportunities?   

### ANSWER: 
If I am investor and I am evaluating all of this, I say, well, yes, it is normal. To see unemployment, go up, to see inflation to go down, to see the fiscal deficit to go up, to see interest rates go to zero. But the elements of risk there. There is a risk with such a high unemployment rate which could cause instability, dissatisfaction, may be turmoil. There is risk of large recessionary gap. My market which I would like to serve as an investor is shrinking, right? There is a risk of that very, very low interest rate, the risk simply being that I can’t get it down any further. So monetary policy has reached its end, except for the non-conventional policies. Which would be quantitative easing for instance, which Europe eventually did. And I am thinking about risk of the debt, as we have said, that debt is now at the end of this period very high. The cost of servicing it has become very quiet high. These are risk for an investor because they don’t know what will happen to their taxes in the future. To the confident the foreigners in the economy in the future.  Will the interest rates go up further because foreigners are afraid Spain can’t pay debt?
